+Please create a clean project structure for a PyTorch IoT project. It should have a:
+
+-a src/ folder which has:
+	-dataset.py
+	-model.py
+	-train.py
+
+-a scripts/ folder which has:
+	-generate_data.py 
+
+-empty folders:
+	-data/
+	-results/
+	-frontend/
+
+Don’t write any code yet

# 2025-12-03 14:52:44.393756
+Implement the synthetic data generation script in scripts/generate_data.py
+
+Using numpy and pandas:
+
+-Generate 1000 rows of a synthetic IoT dataset with these columns: temperature, humidity, light, co2, and a label such as target
+
+-Use random normal distribution for the sensor values and target should be computed as a linear combination of the 4 sensor values. Add some noise to be more realistic.
+-Save the CSV file in data/iot_data.csv
+

# 2025-12-03 14:58:52.561282
+Now implement dataset.py to load the data:
+
+
+-Load the CSV file at data/iot_data.csv
+-Split the data into train and test sets (80/20)
+-Convert the input features and labels into PyTorch float tensors

# 2025-12-03 15:10:36.970859
+
+In src/model.py: Implement a simple model which:
+
+-takes the 4 sensor values and predicts an output(target).
+
+In src/train.py:
+-Load the data using load_iot_data() from dataset.py.
+-Train the model for 20 epochs.
+-Calculate the MSE, RMSE, and MAE of the test set.
+-Print the metrics for each epoch.
+-Save the training and test results into results.json.

# 2025-12-03 15:17:04.155879
+Create a simple TypeScript frontend UI in the frontend/ folder that reads the results from results/results.json and prints them in a nice way.
+
+It should include:
+
+-create a file frontend/display.ts
+-load JSON file results/results.json
+-print each epoch’s MSE, RMSE and MAE to the console
+-also print the final metrics summary after the last epoch
+-add a small README inside frontend/ with how to install typescript and how to run the script using ts-node
+

+Create a simple TypeScript frontend UI in the frontend/ folder that reads the results from results/results.json
+
+In frontend/ create:
+-index.html: has a clean title “IoT Model Results”, a button to load results, a table area where the epoch metrics will be displayed and a simple chart area
+
+-ui.ts: loads results from results/results.json using fetch(), fill an HTML table with each epoch’s metrics, and display final metrics clearly and draw a simple line chart of MSE across epochs
+(Don’t use external libraries)
+
+Again, keep everything simple and don’t use external libraries.

# 2025-12-03 15:47:36.261725
+Please fix the frontend UI so that it does not use Chart.js or any external libraries.

# 2025-12-03 17:01:48.071050
+In the frontend/ui.ts update the drawChart() function to add x axis label:Epoch and y axis label MSE. Also make the chart centered

# 2025-12-03 17:05:45.141175
+I need you to update the ‘ui.ts’ so the MSE chart is fully visible, stretched, and properly labeled.
+
+Make the following changes:
+
+Rewrite ‘drawChart()’ so that:
+   - The chart has visible X and Y axes.
+   - Axes have labels: "Epoch" (X-axis) and "MSE" (Y-axis).
+   - There is enough padding so the labels are not cut off.
+   - The chart scales correctly even if MSE values are large.
+   - The chart line is drawn clearly across the entire canvas.
+
+Do NOT use Chart.js. Only use vanilla HTML5 Canvas.
+
+Make sure the axis lines, labels, and chart line all render cleanly.

# 2025-12-03 18:02:57.881210
+help me debug why the labels on the chart are not displayinh

# 2025-12-03 21:28:43.197159
+write a README file in the root project directory describing the summary of the project
